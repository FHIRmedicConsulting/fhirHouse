/**
 * TerminologyCapabilities (`/metadata?mode=terminology`) — the statement a FHIR terminology
 * client (e.g. the HL7 Java validator when pointed at us as its `-tx` server) fetches to learn
 * which code systems this server can validate/expand locally. Generated from the loaded
 * `codesystem_concept` table so it reflects what the operator actually provisioned.
 *
 * The validator uses `codeSystem[].uri` to decide which systems to delegate to us; systems we
 * don't list, it resolves from its own bundled packages.
