/**
 * Ronin-specific utilities that aren't part of `@fhirengine/fhir-types`.
 *
 * Most FHIR types come from the generated `@fhirengine/fhir-types` package (R4
 * core today; per-IG profile narrowings will land incrementally). The
 * generated types are stricter than what Ronin hand-rolled — typed
 * `Reference<T>` targets, value-set enum unions, closed `resourceType`
 * unions on `Resource`. This module adds the small set of Ronin-side
 * helpers that don't have a generated equivalent:
 *
 *   - `SearchsetBundle<T>` — generated `Bundle` is non-generic; we wrap it
 *     so route code can keep typing search responses by entry resource type.
 *   - `patientIdFromReference()` — extracts the `<id>` portion of a
 *     `Patient/<id>` Reference. The reverse of `Reference<"Patient">`'s
 *     template-literal type.
 *
 * Per session-022 migration plan §4.1.
