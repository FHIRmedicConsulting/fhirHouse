/**
 * Zod schemas for REST-boundary FHIR resource validation.
 *
 * Post-A3 (session 023): generated types from `@fhirengine/fhir-types` own the
 * type SHAPE. Zod's residual job is the load-bearing REST-boundary
 * **cardinality + enum + required-field** checks — what the FHIR spec
 * actually requires at the wire. Helper datatype schemas (Period, Identifier,
 * Reference, etc.) were decommissioned: `.passthrough()` carries the shape
 * through without re-typing it here, and `as Patient` / `as Coverage` /
 * `as ExplanationOfBenefit` casts at the route layer narrow to the generated
 * types.
 *
 * Per ADR-0015 §2: this is the shoulder gate, not the conformance gate.
 * Profile-level validation (must-support, value-set binding, slicing,
 * FHIRPath invariants) is downstream in the Silver-tier Spark transpiler;
 * full FHIR shape correctness is enforced by the generated types at the
 * TypeScript layer.
 *
 * What stays at the REST boundary:
 *   - `resourceType` literal (discriminator).
 *   - Required-field presence (status, beneficiary, payor, insurance, ...).
 *   - Required-array cardinality (`payor[]>=1`, `insurance[]>=1`).
 *   - Enum-bound fields (status, use, outcome, gender).
 *
 * Anything outside that list is preserved via `.passthrough()` and validated
 * downstream.
