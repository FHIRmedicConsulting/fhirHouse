# Inferno (g)(10) — setup + first findings

Status: **harness operational; first conformance slice run.** Local-first per ADR-0020.

## Harness

- **Kit:** ONC Certification (g)(10) Standardized API Test Kit (`inferno-framework/g10-certification-test-kit`),
  brought up via its docker-compose (inferno + worker + redis + nginx + `hl7_validator_service`).
  Bundles the SMART App Launch (STU1/2/2.2), US Core Server (v3.1.1–v6.1.0), and TLS suites.
- **Server under test:** RoninStandAlone booted end-to-end (Python delta sidecar + TS/Hono server)
  against a copy of the provisioned store (`.delta-prov` → US Core 6.1.0 profiles + terminology).
  Reachable from Inferno at `http://host.docker.internal:3000`.
- **Driver:** `scratchpad/inferno/run.py` drives the Inferno JSON API headlessly
  (create session → run group → poll → results). Auth-mode inputs need `type: "auth_info"`.

## What this session added to the server (SMART discovery + auth gate slice)

- `GET /.well-known/smart-configuration` — discovery doc from the active SmartVersionRegistry.
- `/metadata` `rest[].security` SMART-on-FHIR service + `oauth-uris` extension.
- 401 + `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` on protected routes; discovery/metadata/health stay public.
- CapabilityStatement: `instantiates` us-core-server (when US Core installed); `format` JSON-only.

## Run 1 — US Core v6.1.0 › Capability Statement group

`us_core_v610-...-us_core_v610_capability_statement`, `url` only (no token, no data needed).

| Test | Result | Note |
|---|---|---|
| us_core_fhir_version | ✅ PASS | R4 (4.0.1) |
| us_core_json_support | ✅ PASS | JSON advertised |
| us_core_profile_support | ✅ PASS | **provisioned US Core supportedProfile accepted** |
| us_core_instantiate | ✅ PASS | after adding `instantiates` (fixed this run) |
| us_core_conformance_support | ⚠️ FAIL (environmental) | local validator has no tx server → can't resolve `application/fhir+json` in the IANA MimeType ValueSet. The code is valid; the official run uses a terminology server. |
| standalone_auth_tls | ⚠️ FAIL (environmental) | server on plain `http` locally; TLS terminates at the proxy in deployment. |

**4/4 code-relevant checks pass.** The 2 fails are environment artifacts (no tx server in the
local validator; no TLS on the local http listener), not server defects.

### Fixes applied (committed)
- `instantiates: ["…/us/core/CapabilityStatement/us-core-server"]` when a US Core profile is installed.
- `format: ["application/fhir+json"]` — dropped the bare `"json"` shorthand (JSON-only, honest).

## Run 2 — US Core v6.1.0 › Patient group (data: US Core `Patient-example`, tag `uscore-example`)

`patient_ids=example`, open server (auth off). **8 PASS / 2 skip / (must-support skip + validation error).**

| Test | Result | Note |
|---|---|---|
| _id / identifier / name searches | ✅ PASS | incl. compound birthdate+family, family+gender, birthdate+name, gender+name |
| Patient read | ✅ PASS | |
| _id search | ✅ PASS | **after fixing POST `[type]/_search`** (Inferno's _id test also POSTs `/_search`) |
| death-date+family search | ⏭️ SKIP | example patient isn't deceased (data) |
| Provenance `_revinclude` | ⏭️ SKIP | no Provenance for the patient (data) |
| must-support | ⏭️ SKIP | single example lacks `deceasedDateTime`, `communication` (data breadth → Synthea) |
| validation | ⚠️ ERROR | validator cold-start timeout (`hl7_validator_service`); transient/environmental |

### Fixes applied (committed) — both real defects surfaced by Inferno
- **POST `[type]/_search`** (form-encoded search, union of body + URL params) — FHIR search spec /
  US Core requirement; GET search refactored into a shared executor and reused.
- **Startup table discovery** (`DeltaWarehouse.registerExistingTables`) — a restarted server now
  registers on-disk bronze/silver/gold tables so it can read data it didn't write this process
  (registration was in-memory; a restart made existing data invisible to search). Wired into the
  server entry. Covered by `delta-post-search` test.

The 2 skips + must-support skip + validation error are all **data breadth / validator warmup**,
not server defects — addressed by loading Synthea (deceased + communication + Provenance) next.

## Run 3 — US Core v6.1.0 › Patient group, with Synthea (`synthea` tag) + example

Loaded a **deceased Synthea patient** (US Core profiled, 830-entry transaction; has
`deceasedDateTime` + `communication`) alongside the US Core `example`. `patient_ids` = both.

**11 PASS** (all 8 searches incl. `death-date+family`, read, **validation**, **must-support**) +
1 Inferno-tool error:

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| all search tests (incl. death-date+family) | ✅ PASS |
| read | ✅ PASS |
| validation (HL7 validator) | ✅ PASS |
| must-support | ✅ PASS (Synthea patient supplied `deceasedDateTime`/`communication`) |
| Provenance `_revinclude` | ⚠️ ERROR — Inferno `fhir_client` 6.2.0 `const_get "sid"`; **our response is correct** (returns Patient + Provenance, all references valid PascalCase) — Inferno-side, not a server defect |

### Fix applied (committed) — real validation bug surfaced by loading Synthea
- **Choice-type (`[x]`) required-element check.** The profile required-element validator compared
  the literal name, so `medication[x]` was never satisfied by the concrete
  `medicationCodeableConcept` → it **false-rejected valid US Core/Synthea resources** (and
  blocked the atomic transaction load entirely). Fixed with `elementPresent()`: a `foo[x]`
  requirement is met by any concrete `fooType` form (e.g. `valueQuantity` for `value[x]`).
  Unit-tested (`element-present`). This unblocked the full 830-resource Synthea load.

### Data loading
- Synthea transaction bundles load via the existing transaction endpoint (urn:uuid resolved).
  Bundles are **atomic** — one invalid entry fails the whole bundle, which is how the
  `medication[x]` bug surfaced. Resources tagged `meta.tag` dataset = `synthea` | `uscore-example`.

## Run 4 — US Core v6.1.0 clinical resource groups (Synthea data, 16 groups)

First pass returned **all-skip** (patient-scoped searches found nothing). Root cause: a real
reference-search bug — Inferno searches `patient=<bare id>`, but our index stores the full
`Patient/<id>` and only exact-matched, so `Condition?patient=<id>` → 0 while
`Condition?patient=Patient/<id>` → 38.

### Fix applied (committed) — bare-id reference search
- `buildIndexPred` now handles `reference` type distinctly: a full `Type/id` (or URL) matches
  exactly; a **bare id matches any stored `Type/<id>`** (`… LIKE '%/<id>'`). Regression test
  `delta-reference-search`. After the fix, the clinical surface went from all-skip to mostly-pass:
  many search + read tests PASS (encounter, condition-encounter-diagnosis, document-reference,
  smokingstatus, diagnostic-report-lab, immunization, blood-pressure, care-plan…).

### Remaining, triaged
- **Conditional references not resolved (real gap, larger follow-up).** Synthea persists
  `reference: "Practitioner?identifier=http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/us-npi|…"` /
  `"Organization?identifier=https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea|…"`. Our transaction
  handler resolves `urn:uuid:` but NOT conditional (`Type?query`) references, so they persist
  literally — which is non-conformant (persisted refs must be literal) and makes Inferno's
  `fhir_client` throw `wrong constant name sid`/`synthetichealth`. Fix needs org/practitioner
  preload + conditional-reference resolution in the transaction processor.
- **Validator connection errors** (`hl7_validator_service:3500`) on `validation`/`reference_resolution`
  tests — the shared validator was saturated running 16 groups back-to-back; environmental, not
  a server defect (single-group runs validate fine).
- **Compound token searches** (`patient+category+status`, `patient+intent+status`) reported
  "could not find <status/intent> values" for some groups — to re-verify on a stable single-group
  run (several batch entries also hit transient `localhost:3000` unavailability under load).

## Run 5 — conditional references resolved (fixes the `fhir_client` errors)

### Fix applied (committed)
- **Transaction conditional-reference resolution.** `Type?identifier=sys|val` references (Synthea
  emits these for `Practitioner`/`Organization`/`Location`) are now resolved to literal `Type/<id>`
  during transaction processing — bundle-local matches first, else a server identifier lookup.
  Unresolvable conditional refs reject the transaction (per spec). A persisted reference is now
  always literal.
- **`ifNoneExist` conditional create.** POST entries with `ifNoneExist=identifier=…` skip creation
  when a match exists (idempotent) — makes the Synthea `hospitalInformation`/`practitionerInformation`
  bundles reloadable and their resources findable.
- Test `delta-conditional-reference` (resolve → literal, ifNoneExist dedup, unresolvable → 422).

### Loading order + verification
- Load `hospitalInformation` + `practitionerInformation` (as transactions) first, then the patient
  bundles. Encounter references now come back **literal** (`Location/…`, `Organization/…`,
  `Practitioner/…`) — zero unresolved conditional refs.
- Re-run after the fix: **the `fhir_client` "wrong constant name sid/synthetichealth" errors are
  gone.** Encounter 9 PASS, DiagnosticReport-lab 7 PASS, DocumentReference 9 PASS.
- Remaining errors are environmental: `hl7_validator_service:3500` connection failures when several
  groups run back-to-back (the shared validator saturates), and occasional transient
  `localhost:3000` unavailability under concurrent load. One small real finding remains
  (`document_reference` patient+status compound search).

## Known headless-Inferno friction

- The SMART **discovery** sub-group is nested under a `run_as_group` Standalone-Launch parent, so it
  can't be isolated from the full OAuth flow via the API. Our discovery doc + capability + 401 are
  covered by the `smart-discovery` unit test instead; a full Inferno discovery pass needs the SMART
  authorization server (next).

## Remaining work (in priority order)

1. **Test data (next):** load Synthea synthetic + US Core IG example resources, **tagged by dataset**
   (`meta.tag` dataset=synthea | uscore-example), then run the US Core **Patient / clinical** groups
   (read/search/`_revinclude`/must-support) with `patient_ids`. Attribute pass/fail per dataset.
2. **SMART authorization server** (`/authorize`, `/token`, launch context) — unblocks the SMART
   App Launch suites + the OAuth-gated US Core groups + full (g)(10).
3. **Terminology-bound validator** for the conformance test (tx server or built bloom filters).
4. **TLS** for the TLS suite (deploy/proxy).
